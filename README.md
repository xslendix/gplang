## Features

This language has some really cool things that set it apart from others:

##### The d*ck literal

This is the only way to specify integers. It's quite simple really, the longer

```
8=====D // has the value of 5.
8D      // has the value of 0.
```

You can awso get negative integers by using the unary minus operatow.
